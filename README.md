**Election Management System**

**Overview** :

The Election Management System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the management of elections. It provides a user-friendly interface for updating leader details, managing voter data, casting votes, and displaying election results. The system aims to streamline the election process, making it more efficient and accessible for both leaders and voters.

**Problem Statement** :

In the current electoral landscape, managing elections can be a complex and cumbersome process. Challenges include:
- Difficulty in updating and managing leader information.
- Inefficient handling of voter data and registration.
- Complicated voting processes that can lead to confusion among voters.
- Lack of transparency in displaying election results.

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive Election Management System that simplifies the election process, ensuring a seamless experience for all stakeholders involved.

**Tech Stack** :

- Programming Language : Java
- GUI Framework : Swing for user interface development
- Data Structures : HashMap, Binary Search Tree, Stack, Linked List

**Tech Stack Implementation** :

Programming Language :

Java : The core programming language used to develop the application, leveraging its object-oriented features for modular design and maintainability.

GUI Framework :

Swing : Utilized for building the graphical user interface, providing components for user interaction such as buttons, text fields, and panels.

Data Structures :

- HashMap : Used to store leader objects with their IDs as keys for quick access.
- Binary Search Tree (BST) : Manages voter data efficiently, allowing for quick insertion and retrieval.
- Stack : Simulates trash functionality for deleted leaders, enabling easy recovery.
- Linked List : (Not explicitly used in the provided code but can be integrated for additional functionalities).

**Key Features and Implementation** :

**Leader Management** :

- Add New Leaders : Users can input details to add new leaders to the system.
- Update Leader Details : Existing leader information can be modified as needed.
- Delete Leaders : Leaders can be removed from the system, with the option to recover from trash.
- Display Leaders : A list of all leaders can be viewed, showing their details.

**Voter Management** :

- Add New Voters : Users can register new voters by entering their details.
- Update Voter Information : Existing voter details can be updated.
- View Voter Information : Users can view the list of registered voters.

**Voting Process**
- Cast Votes : Voters can select their preferred leaders and cast their votes.
- Display Election Results : After voting, users can view the results of the election.
